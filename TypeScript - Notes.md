# **What Is TypeScript**

TypeScript is an open source language and is a superset of JavaScript.

-   Offers additional features to JavaScript including static types.
-   Using types is compleately **oprional**.
-   Compiles down to regular JS.
-   Can be used for front-end JS as well as backend with Node.js.
-   Includes most features from ES6, ES7 (classes, arrow functions, etc).
-   Types from 3rd party libraries can be added with **type definitions**.

## **Dynamic vs Static Typing**

In **dynamically typed languages**, the types are associated with run-time values and not names explicitly in your code.

In **statically typed languages**, you explicitly assign types to variables, function parameters, return values, etc.

### **Static Examples:**

-   Java
-   C
-   C++
-   Rust
-   Go

### **Dynamic Examples:**

-   JavaScript
-   Python
-   Ruby
-   PHP

## **Pros & Cons**

### **Pros:**

-   More Robust
-   Easily Spot Bugs
-   Predictability
-   Readability
-   Popular

### **Cons:**

-   More Code To Write
-   More To Learn
-   Requiered Compilation
-   Not True Static Typing

## **Compiling TypeScript**

-   TypeScript uses **.ts** and **.tsx** extensions.
-   **TSC** (TypeScript Compiler) is used to compile .ts files down to JS.
-   Can watch files and report errors at compile time.
-   Maty tools include TS compilation by default.
-   Most IDEs have great support for TS.
-   The **tsconfig.json** file is used to configure how TypeScript works.
