# **What is TypeScript?**

TypeScript is an open source language and is a superset of JavaScript.

-   Offers additional features to JavaScript including static types.
-   Using types is compleately **optional**.
-   Compiles down to regular JS.
-   Can be used for front-end JS as well as backend with Node.js.
-   Includes most features from ES6, ES7 (classes, arrow functions, etc).
-   Types from 3rd party libraries can be added with **type definitions**.

## **Dynamic vs Static Typing**

In **dynamically typed languages**, the types are associated with run-time values and not named explicitly in your code.

In **statically typed languages**, you explicitly assign types to variables, function parameters, return values, etc.

**Static Examples:**

-   Java
-   C
-   C++
-   Rust
-   Go

**Dynamic Examples:**

-   JavaScript
-   Python
-   Ruby
-   PHP

## **Compiling TypeScript**

-   TypeScript uses **.ts** and **.tsx** extensions.
-   **TSC** (TypeScript Compiler) is used to compile .ts files down to JS.
-   Can watch files and report errors at compile time.
-   Many toole include TS compilation by default.
-   Most IDSs have great support for TS.
